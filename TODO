#This file lists unresolved issues for the java-infrastucture project

* A better way of tracking issues needs to be found.
* There is no Javadoc in the source, and no way to easily produce this.
* The output of the class is not internationalised.
* The class must be recompiled to edit the strings it uses.
* Work out how to maintain and enforce a consistent build environment and tools (ie Java and gradle)
* Find a way to show that the gradle distribution used by the wrapper is trustworthy
