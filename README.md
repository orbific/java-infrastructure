# java-infrastructure
An example of Java infrastructure, based on blog posts on riddlefox.com

What I want to do with this project – both on my blog and on github – is to build up a generic piece of 
software with simple Java code, but a rich infrastructure. I think there is a lot to learn from this – 
and at the end I’ll have a good base to work from with my own future projects.

The blog series discussing this can be found here:
